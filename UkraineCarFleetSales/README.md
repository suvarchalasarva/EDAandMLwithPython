### DATA CLEANSING
![image1](\images\unorg_data)
- Data is not always good to us, hence when we get RAW/UNORGANIZED DATA, we have to cleanse it removing bad characters, missing values, dropping duplicates and make it ORGANIZED DATA
- Python Pandas allows us with different functions and makes the job easy
